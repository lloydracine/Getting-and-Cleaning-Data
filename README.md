# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

### Introduction

This repository is for the Course Project of the DataScience track's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course which will be peer assessed.

#### Summary

This repository includes a single script "run_analysis.R", that merges data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set project at the UCI Machine Learning Repository to produce average values per user per activity for the dataset's mean and standard deviation features. Refer to the included codebook.md for more information.

#### Usage

Run the script run_analysis.R. The script produces a single output file, tidyData.csv, that contains the merged and transformed data.
